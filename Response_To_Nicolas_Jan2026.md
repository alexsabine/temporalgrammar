Hi Nicolás,

Thank you so much for taking the time to go through the materials! Your framing is exactly what I've been hoping someone would see:

> *"FEP/Active Inference providing the fast, locally Markovian inferential machinery, and CRR supplying a slow-manifold temporal grammar that captures ontological reorganisation across development and interaction."*

This captures it perfectly. The slow-manifold framing is what makes CRR distinct from standard FEP treatments—it's asking what accumulates *as* free energy reduces, and what happens when that accumulated coherence reaches threshold.

I've prepared a summary document for Tuesday that covers:

**1. What's been achieved:**
- 24 independent mathematical proof sketches (information geometry, martingale theory, ergodic theory, category theory, etc.)
- Empirical validation across biological systems (wound healing R²=0.999, muscle hypertrophy R²=0.999, saltatory growth 11/11 predictions)
- 88 interactive simulations at cohere.org.uk
- Complete FEP-CRR integration showing precision-rigidity correspondence: Π = (1/Ω)·exp(C/Ω)

**2. The critical periods connection** (your suggestion):
This maps beautifully. I'm proposing:
- Critical periods = elevated Ω (high plasticity, broad memory access)
- CP closure = decreasing Ω with maturation
- CP reopening (Cisneros-Franco) = Ω elevation through intervention

This gives CRR a principled developmental interpretation grounded in the neuroscience literature.

**3. Book chapters available:**
The monograph currently has 5 complete chapters plus a detailed prologue with translation tables mapping CRR to 12 different domains. Happy to share whichever chapters would be most useful for identifying a paper focus.

**4. Publication ideas by strength:**
- **Tier 1**: "CRR as Temporal Grammar for Active Inference" (mathematical framework complete)
- **Tier 2**: "Critical Periods as Ω Modulation" (your area!)
- **Tier 3**: "16 Nats Hypothesis" (mean 15.6 nats across 16 systems, p>0.4 from prediction)

The summary document also includes an honest epistemic status assessment—CRR is rigorous conjecture, not proven theory, and I think it's important to be clear about that.

Looking forward to Tuesday! The document is in the shared drive.

Best,
Alexander

## Key Points for Meeting

### What Nicolás Brings
- Expertise in plasticity and critical periods
- Connection to broader Active Inference community
- Academic publication experience

### What to Discuss
1. Which paper to prioritise for first collaboration
2. His thoughts on the critical periods interpretation
3. Strategy for Peter (Thursday) and Maxwell (end of Jan) meetings
4. Timeline for first draft

### Potential First Paper Topics
1. **Critical Periods as Ω Modulation** - Nicolás's strength, clear biological grounding
2. **FEP-CRR Integration** - More theoretical, may need Maxwell's input
3. **Royal Society Phil Trans A** - Open call on agency closes March 31

### Questions for Nicolás
1. What's his current research focus?
2. Has he worked with Knudsen/Cisneros-Franco literature specifically?
3. Does he have existing data that could test CRR predictions?
4. What's his publishing timeline/capacity?

## Addendum: Tucker & Luu Context

Recent publication: Tucker, Luu, and Friston (2025) - "The Criticality of Inference" in Entropy journal, exploring:
- Working memory and consciousness
- Phasic arousal and tonic activation balance at criticality
- Active inference as motivated process regulated by limbic base

This provides additional context for the biological grounding of Ω claims through their work on criticality in neural systems.
