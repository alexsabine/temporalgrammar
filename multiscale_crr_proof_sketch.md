# Multi-Scale CRR: A Rigorous Proof Sketch

## The Infinite Regression Conjecture

This note extends the canonical CRR formalism to multiple scales, formalising the conjecture that:

> **The mnemonic entanglement density L at scale N is the coarse-grained trace of completed CRR cycles at scale N-1.**

In other words: what appears as smooth accumulation ∫L(τ)dτ at one scale is actually counting discrete rupture events at finer scales. CRR is self-similar — it's "the same process all the way down."

## 1. Notation and Standing Assumptions

### 1.1 Scale Index

Let n ∈ ℕ₀ = {0, 1, 2, ...} index **observation scales**, where:
- n = 0 is the finest resolved scale
- Increasing n corresponds to coarser temporal grain

### 1.2 Scale-Indexed CRR Variables

For each scale n, define:
- **Coherence**: C⁽ⁿ⁾(t) ∈ [0, ∞)
- **Porosity capacity**: Ω⁽ⁿ⁾ > 0
- **Mnemonic entanglement density**: L⁽ⁿ⁾(t) ≥ 0
- **Rupture times**: T⁽ⁿ⁾ = {t₁⁽ⁿ⁾, t₂⁽ⁿ⁾, ...} (the set of times at which rupture occurs at scale n)

### 1.3 Assumptions

**(M1) Scale Separation.** There exists a hierarchy of timescales such that dynamics at scale n are "fast" relative to scale n+1. Formally, the characteristic cycle time at scale n, denoted τ⁽ⁿ⁾, satisfies:
$$\tau^{(n+1)} \gg \tau^{(n)}$$

**(M2) Ω-Scaling.** The porosity capacities across scales are related by a scaling function:
$$\Omega^{(n+1)} = \sigma(\Omega^{(n)})$$
where σ: ℝ₊ → ℝ₊ is monotonically increasing. 

*Conjecture*: σ(Ω) = π · Ω (i.e., geometric scaling with ratio π), but this requires derivation from first principles.

**(M3) Finest-Scale Input.** Scale 0 receives external environmental input:
$$L^{(0)}(t) = \ell(t) \geq 0$$
where ℓ(t) is the environmental signal (e.g., sensory prediction error, thermodynamic flux).

**(M4) Integrability.** All L⁽ⁿ⁾ are locally integrable on [0, T] for any finite T.

## 2. Canonical CRR at Each Scale (Review)

At each scale n, the standard CRR operators apply:

### 2.1 Coherence Accumulation
$$\boxed{\mathcal{C}^{(n)}(t) = \int_{t_j^{(n)}}^{t} L^{(n)}(\tau) \, d\tau}$$
where t_j⁽ⁿ⁾ is the most recent rupture time at scale n (with t₀⁽ⁿ⁾ = 0).

### 2.2 Rupture Condition
$$\boxed{t_*^{(n)} = \inf\{t > t_j^{(n)} : \mathcal{C}^{(n)}(t) \geq \Omega^{(n)}\}}$$

### 2.3 Reset
$$\boxed{\mathcal{C}^{(n)}(t_*^{(n)+}) = 0}$$

### 2.4 Regeneration
$$\boxed{\mathcal{R}^{(n)}(t_*^{(n)}) = \int_{t_j^{(n)}}^{t_*^{(n)}} \Phi^{(n)}(\tau) \cdot e^{\mathcal{C}^{(n)}(t_*^{(n)})/\Omega^{(n)}} \cdot \Theta(t_*^{(n)} - \tau) \, d\tau}$$

At rupture, C⁽ⁿ⁾ = Ω⁽ⁿ⁾, so exp(C⁽ⁿ⁾/Ω⁽ⁿ⁾) = e (Euler calibration).

---

## 3. The Scale Coupling Principle (New)

### 3.1 Core Axiom: Rupture-to-Density Coupling

**Definition 1 (Scale Coupling).** The mnemonic entanglement density at scale n+1 is generated by rupture events at scale n:

$$\boxed{L^{(n+1)}(t) = \sum_{t_k^{(n)} \in T^{(n)}} \lambda^{(n)} \cdot \mathcal{R}^{(n)}(t_k^{(n)}) \cdot \delta(t - t_k^{(n)})}$$

where:
- T⁽ⁿ⁾ is the set of rupture times at scale n
- R⁽ⁿ⁾(t_k) is the regeneration value at rupture
- λ⁽ⁿ⁾ > 0 is the inter-scale coupling strength
- δ(·) is the Dirac delta

**Interpretation:** Each rupture at scale n contributes a discrete "packet" of coherence-work to scale n+1. Between ruptures, L⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾ = 0. The macro-scale only "sees" completed micro-cycles.

### 3.2 Integrated Form

For practical computation, integrating L⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾ over an interval [0, t]:

$$\mathcal{C}^{(n+1)}(t) = \int_0^t L^{(n+1)}(\tau) \, d\tau = \sum_{t_k^{(n)} < t} \lambda^{(n)} \cdot \mathcal{R}^{(n)}(t_k^{(n)})$$

**Proposition 1 (Coherence as Cycle Count).** The coherence at scale n+1 is a weighted count of completed CRR cycles at scale n:

$$\boxed{\mathcal{C}^{(n+1)}(t) = \lambda^{(n)} \sum_{k=1}^{N^{(n)}(t)} \mathcal{R}^{(n)}(t_k^{(n)})}$$

where N⁽ⁿ⁾(t) = |{t_k⁽ⁿ⁾ ∈ T⁽ⁿ⁾ : t_k⁽ⁿ⁾ < t}| is the number of ruptures at scale n before time t.

**Proof.** Direct consequence of integrating the delta-sum. ∎

---

## 4. Self-Similarity and Scale Invariance

### 4.1 Normalised Dynamics

**Definition 2 (Normalised Coherence).** Define the fractional coherence:
$$\hat{\mathcal{C}}^{(n)}(t) := \frac{\mathcal{C}^{(n)}(t)}{\Omega^{(n)}} \in [0, 1]$$

Rupture occurs when ĉ⁽ⁿ⁾ = 1 at all scales.

### 4.2 Self-Similarity Condition

**Definition 3 (Statistical Self-Similarity).** The CRR dynamics are statistically self-similar if the normalised inter-rupture intervals have the same distribution at all scales:

$$\frac{\Delta t_k^{(n)}}{\mathbb{E}[\Delta t^{(n)}]} \stackrel{d}{=} \frac{\Delta t_k^{(m)}}{\mathbb{E}[\Delta t^{(m)}]} \quad \forall n, m$$

where Δt_k⁽ⁿ⁾ = t_{k+1}⁽ⁿ⁾ - t_k⁽ⁿ⁾ is the k-th inter-rupture interval at scale n.

**Proposition 2 (Necessary Condition for Self-Similarity).** If the dynamics are statistically self-similar and L⁽⁰⁾ is stationary, then the coefficient of variation CV⁽ⁿ⁾ of inter-rupture intervals is constant across scales:

$$CV^{(n)} := \frac{\text{Std}[\Delta t^{(n)}]}{\mathbb{E}[\Delta t^{(n)}]} = CV \quad \forall n$$

**Remark.** The simulation showed CV *decreasing* with scale (0.192 → 0.066), suggesting dynamics are not perfectly self-similar. Higher scales exhibit *more regular* dynamics. This may be a consequence of central-limit-type averaging: many micro-cycles compose each macro-cycle.

---

## 5. Emergence of Regularity at Higher Scales

### 5.1 Macro-Cycle as Sum of Micro-Cycles

**Proposition 3 (Cycle Composition).** Let M⁽ⁿ⁾ denote the (random) number of scale-n ruptures required to trigger one scale-(n+1) rupture. Then:

$$\Delta t^{(n+1)} = \sum_{j=1}^{M^{(n)}} \Delta t_j^{(n)}$$

**Proof.** The scale-(n+1) cycle completes when C⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾ = Ω⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾. Since C⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾ increments only at scale-n ruptures, the macro-cycle spans exactly M⁽ⁿ⁾ micro-cycles, where M⁽ⁿ⁾ is the first passage count. ∎

### 5.2 Central Limit Behaviour

**Theorem 1 (Regularisation at Higher Scales).** Assume:
1. The inter-rupture intervals Δt⁽ⁿ⁾ are i.i.d. with finite variance
2. M⁽ⁿ⁾ → ∞ as Ω⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾/Ω⁽ⁿ⁾ → ∞

Then the normalised macro-intervals converge to Gaussian:

$$\frac{\Delta t^{(n+1)} - \mathbb{E}[\Delta t^{(n+1)}]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[\Delta t^{(n+1)}]}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$

and the coefficient of variation decreases:

$$CV^{(n+1)} \approx \frac{CV^{(n)}}{\sqrt{M^{(n)}}}$$

**Proof Sketch.** This follows from the classical CLT applied to Proposition 3. If M⁽ⁿ⁾ micro-cycles compose one macro-cycle, and M⁽ⁿ⁾ is large, the sum of i.i.d. intervals converges to Gaussian with variance growing as M and standard deviation as √M. Since the mean grows as M, CV ~ 1/√M. ∎

**Interpretation:** CRR is not perfectly self-similar — higher scales are *more regular*. This is not a bug but a feature: macro-patterns inherit stability from averaging over many micro-patterns. This may explain why physical laws appear deterministic at macro-scales despite quantum indeterminacy below.

---

## 6. Inevitability of Rupture for Bounded Observers

### 6.1 The Existence Cost Axiom

**Axiom (Irreducible Maintenance).** A bounded observer (Markov blanket) incurs a minimum positive rate of coherence accumulation merely by existing:

$$L^{(n)}(t) \geq \epsilon > 0 \quad \text{for all } t$$

**Interpretation:** You cannot be a boundary between inside and outside without maintaining that boundary. Maintenance has a cost. The cost accumulates.

### 6.2 Finite-Time Rupture

**Theorem 2 (Inevitable Rupture).** Under the Irreducible Maintenance axiom, rupture occurs in finite time at every scale:

$$t_*^{(n)} \leq \frac{\Omega^{(n)}}{\epsilon} < \infty$$

**Proof.** 
$$\mathcal{C}^{(n)}(t) = \int_0^t L^{(n)}(\tau) \, d\tau \geq \int_0^t \epsilon \, d\tau = \epsilon t$$

Setting C⁽ⁿ⁾(t*) = Ω⁽ⁿ⁾ gives t* ≤ Ω⁽ⁿ⁾/ε. ∎

**Corollary (No Escape Strategy).** No engagement strategy can avoid rupture indefinitely. An agent that "refuses to observe" merely reduces L toward ε but cannot eliminate it.

---

## 7. The Recursive Structure: Infinite Regression

### 7.1 Formal Statement

**Theorem 3 (CRR Infinite Regression).** Under the scale coupling principle (Definition 1), the coherence at any scale n > 0 can be expressed as a nested sum over all finer scales:

$$\mathcal{C}^{(n)}(t) = \Lambda^{(n-1)} \cdot N^{(n-1)}(t)$$

where:
- N⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾(t) counts completed cycles at scale n-1
- Λ⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾ = λ⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾ · 𝔼[ℛ⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾] is the expected contribution per micro-cycle

Recursively:
$$N^{(n-1)}(t) = f(N^{(n-2)}(t)), \quad N^{(n-2)}(t) = f(N^{(n-3)}(t)), \quad \ldots$$

**Interpretation:** The integral at any scale is not accumulating "stuff" — it is counting completed patterns at the next scale down, which are themselves counting completed patterns at the next scale down, ad infinitum.

### 7.2 The Ground Level

**Question:** What happens at scale 0? Is there a finest scale, or does the regression continue indefinitely?

**Option A (Physical Cutoff).** There exists a minimal scale n = 0 where L⁽⁰⁾ is environmental input, not composed of finer CRR cycles. This corresponds to the Planck scale, neural spike timing, or another physical limit.

**Option B (True Infinite Regression).** The regression continues without limit. "Scale 0" is always relative to the observer's resolution. Zooming in reveals more CRR structure.

**Remark.** Option B is more philosophically coherent with the framework but empirically unverifiable beyond certain scales.

## 8. Connection to Ω = 1/π Conjecture

### 8.1 The Scale Ratio Question

From Proposition 3 and the Euler calibration (exp(C/Ω) = e at rupture), the expected number of micro-cycles per macro-cycle is:

$$\mathbb{E}[M^{(n)}] = \frac{\Omega^{(n+1)}}{\lambda^{(n)} \cdot e \cdot \Omega^{(n)}}$$

### 8.2 If Ω⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾ = π · Ω⁽ⁿ⁾

Assuming geometric scaling with ratio π:

$$\mathbb{E}[M^{(n)}] = \frac{\pi}{\lambda^{(n)} \cdot e}$$

For M⁽ⁿ⁾ to be scale-invariant (same expected count at every level), we need λ⁽ⁿ⁾ = λ constant, giving:

$$\mathbb{E}[M] = \frac{\pi}{\lambda \cdot e}$$

### 8.3 The Missing Derivation

The proof sketch cannot yet derive *why* Ω should scale as π between levels. This requires connecting to FEP:

**Conjecture (FEP-CRR Bridge).** If:
1. Precision in active inference corresponds to 1/Ω (inverse porosity)
2. Belief updating threshold corresponds to accumulated evidence = π (half-cycle of oscillation)

Then the scale coupling emerges from the geometry of Bayesian updating under bounded precision.

**This remains the key open question for the January meeting with Ramstead.**

## 10. Testable Predictions

### 10.1 Empirical Predictions

1. **Multi-scale biological data** (e.g., saltatory growth) should show nested threshold-crossing structure: micro-bursts compose macro-bursts compose developmental stages.

2. **Inter-event interval distributions** should become more Gaussian (lower kurtosis) at higher observation scales.

3. **The CV of intervals** should decrease approximately as 1/√M where M is the number of sub-cycles per cycle.

### 10.2 Falsification Criteria

The framework would be challenged if:
- Higher scales showed *more* variability than lower scales
- Macro-coherence accumulated continuously rather than in discrete packets
- A bounded system demonstrated indefinite rupture avoidance
